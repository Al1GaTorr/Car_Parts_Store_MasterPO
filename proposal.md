# Project Proposal
## Digital Car Parts Store Platform for Kazakhstan

---

## 1. Project Overview

The project aims to develop a digital platform for a car parts store in Kazakhstan. The system will help customers find and order automobile spare parts online and assist the store in managing inventory and orders.

At this stage, the project focuses on **business and functional requirements**. User interface design and final user workflows are not defined yet and will be developed in later stages of the project.

## 2. Project Relevance

Car ownership in Kazakhstan is increasing, which leads to higher demand for automobile spare parts. Many customers still rely on offline stores or general online marketplaces that do not specialize in car parts.

This project is relevant because it:
- Improves accessibility to spare parts
- Reduces search and selection time
- Supports the digital transformation of local automotive businesses

## 3. Competitor Analysis

### Offline Car Parts Stores
- Provide direct customer service
- Lack online catalogs and digital inventory management
- Limited search and compatibility checking

### Online Marketplaces (Kaspi, OLX)
- Offer convenience and wide product exposure
- Do not focus on car part compatibility
- Often lack detailed technical information

### International Platforms
- Large selection of spare parts
- Long delivery times
- Higher shipping costs

**Proposed Platform Advantage:**  
Focuses on local availability, faster delivery, and accurate spare part selection tailored to the Kazakhstan market.
